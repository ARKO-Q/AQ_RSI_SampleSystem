  Description:
  This RSI-based trading strategy enters a long position when the RSI drops below X,
  signaling potential oversold conditions, and a short position when the RSI rises above Y,
  indicating potential overbought conditions. Stop-loss orders are set using a multiple
  of the ATR (Average True Range) to adapt to market volatility.
